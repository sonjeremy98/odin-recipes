Odin Project: Recipes (HTML Foundations)
First "big homework/project" of my coding lessons
Project goal: create a site with recipe of my favourite food
Self reflection (done at completion of project)
Lessons:
1. MAKE SURE TO COMMIT OFTEN 
    - Do git status -> git commit -m "message" -> git push origin main -> done
2. Enter html and it will autopopulate
3. Remember that lists always start with <ol> or <ul> followed by <li>item<li> etc
4. Reference to link: <a href="link"></a>
    -Remember the link can be relative or absolute location (examples in this repo)
5. Reference to images: <img src="link">
6. <strong> and <em> better than <b> and <i> (or whatever the alt is) since the first 2 are identifying the words as having those traits
